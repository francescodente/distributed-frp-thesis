% in general, we want to be able to declaratively specify the behavior of distributed systems.
% AC is an approach that solves this problem, but it currently doesn't allow to fine-tune the dynamics an the timing of events.
% With FRP, the objective is to explore these issues and propose a way to control the dynamics and the reactivity of the computations.
% The vision is "functional reactive self organization"
